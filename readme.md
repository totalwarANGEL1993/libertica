This is a script library for THE SETTLERS - Rise of a kingdom.

This library will extend upon the default QSB and extend it with additional
features. Components are all optional (expect for the core) and therefore not
always needed for a running map.

## Usage

- Include questsystembehavior.lua as usual in global script
  (Mission_FirstMapAction)
- Use Require to load components AFTER that in global script
- In local script questsystembehavior.lua is not needed.
- Use Require to load components in local script
  (Mission_LocalOnMapStart)
